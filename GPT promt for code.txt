create a chatGPT promt hat will:
create a ptyhon script that will help me create a summery of many cvs files.
the files are expenses from my bank account.
i want the script to go through the column that has the name of the expenses, for each row, ask the user how to classify the expense, from the list of existing expense classification options. the user has an option to create a new expense classification. 
if the name of the expense has already been classified, the code automatically puts it there.
the output is a list that looks like
expense name : sum of all expenses that were classified as such.
then detailed classification that has the amount and date.

make the code not hard coded in respect to the column's meaning in the original cvs files. make it easy to change from which column the script has to take the date, expense name, expense amount.

add explanation naext to the rows.
